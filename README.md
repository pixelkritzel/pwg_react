mobx-react-boilerplate
=====================

A minimal application that combines [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).
Supports ES6 and JSX compilation through babel.

* For a more sophisticated project to start with, see the full TodoMVC implementation: [mobx-react-todomvc](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-todomvc).
* For simplicity sake Webpack Hot Module Reloading is disabled. If you want to use HMR, see the [Reactive2015 demo](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-reactive2015-demo) to see a valid setup.

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### Credits
